          </h4>
          <p>We may terminate or suspend Your access immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason
            whatsoever, including without limitation if You breach these Terms and Conditions.
          </p>
          <p>Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease immediately.</p>
          <h4>Limitation of Liability</h4>
          <p>Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its
            suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be
            limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service for the period of one month or 10.00 USD if
            You haven’t purchased anything through the Service.</p>
          <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable
            for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to,
            damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal
            injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service,
            third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any
            provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such
            damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.
          </p>
          <p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or
            consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each
            party’s liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
          <h4>“AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” Disclaimer</h4>
          <p>The Service is provided to You “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” and with all faults and defects without warranty
            of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on
            behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims
            all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all
            implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and
            warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without
            limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of
            any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work
            with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any
            performance or reliability standards or be error-free or that any errors or defects can or will be
            corrected.
          </p>
          <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company’s provider makes any
            representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the
            Service, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will
            be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or
            content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent
            from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or
            other harmful components.</p>
          <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable
            statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You.
            But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest
            extent enforceable under applicable law.
          </p>
          <h4>Governing Law</h4>
          <p>The laws of the Country, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Terms and Your use of the
            Service. Your use of the Application may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international
            laws.
          </p>

          <p>If You have any concern or dispute about the Service, You agree to first try to resolve the dispute
            informally by contacting the Company.</p>

          </h6>
          <p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under
